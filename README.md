Named after the tall-ship navigator [Sean Bercraw](https://nautiluslive.org/people/sean-bercaw) who has a romanticized passion for throwing messages-in-a-bottle overboard during his voyages, and the word "jetsom" which "describes debris that was deliberately thrown overboard by a crew of a ship in distress" according to the [NOAA](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html).
